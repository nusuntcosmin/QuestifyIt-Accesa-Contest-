QuestifyIt Documentation

Java app for managing quests created by users. This project was created for Accesa's Summer Internship "Contest". The tools that I used were: JavaFX for graphic user interface, PostgreSQL for storing the data, Gradle for the build sytem and Log4j for logging. Programming concepts used: OOP Concepts ( SOLID, Inheritance, Interfaces,), Generic Programming, Java streams, SQL, Layered Architecture, Service/Repository Pattern, GUI Controllers, Domain Driven Development.

Functionalitites : - Login user/ Register user / Log out user
                   - Update profile (username, mail, password)
                   - Create quests and reward players with tokens
                   - Solve quests and earn tokens and badges
                   - Display quest feed, logged user's created quests, and quests solved by the logged user
                   - Display the ranking based on double criteria ( first : number of quests solved, second: number of tokens earned)
                   - Display the page with badges you've earned (example : created accound badge, won first quest badge)
